# Scouting Analysis for Feyenoord Using Cloud Technologies

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting a scouting analysis for Feyenoord using player data from the 2022-2023 English Premier League season. The objective was to identify potential replacements for striker Santiago Giménez and scout young Dutch players who could fit Feyenoord’s play style and development strategy. The project utilized cloud technologies and big data frameworks to create data-driven visualizations and perform queries on player statistics.

## Objectives
- **Identify a replacement** for Santiago Giménez based on performance metrics from Premier League forwards.
- **Scout Dutch players** who are more likely to adapt well to Feyenoord’s culture and tactical system.
- **Analyze young talent** (under 21) for their playing time and potential development at Feyenoord.

## Key Features
- **Player Statistics Analysis**: Analyzed a detailed dataset of Premier League players, sourced from [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2022-2023/stats/2022-2023-Premier-League-Stats).
- **Three Key Dataframes**:
  - **Forwards Dataframe**: Used to identify replacements for Santiago Giménez.
  - **Dutch Players Dataframe**: Focused on scouting Dutch players for compatibility with Feyenoord.
  - **Young Players Dataframe**: Analyzed players under 21 for future potential.
- **Visualizations**: Created scatter plots and bar charts to visualize metrics like age, match experience, and player performance.

## Queries and Analysis
- **Giménez Replacement**: Compared Giménez’s statistics with other forwards in the Premier League to identify players with similar profiles.
- **Dutch Player Scouting**: Ranked Dutch players based on performance metrics and age to find suitable candidates for Feyenoord.
- **Young Players Analysis**: Explored age distribution and average match experience for players under 21 to identify talent for development.
